# CALOU_self_balancing_robot
CALOU is a two-wheels inverted pendulum controlled by Bluetooth through a smartphone.
It is a personal project entirely manufactured in 3D printing and powered by two RC Brushless BR2804-100T Gimbal Motor and a 2-axis Brushless Gimbal Controller BGC3.1 MOSFET card in a close loop with angle magnetic encoders. Those parts need some modification/adaptation to be assemble. The Controller with the IMU and Bluetooth module HC-05 are located into the head while the Body holds in the center a 500mA – 11.1V – 30C LiPo battery with a switch. The arms and legs of the robot serve as wire guide for motors and encoders.
