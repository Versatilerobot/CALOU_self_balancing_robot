# CALOU_self_balancing_robot
CALOU is a two-wheels inverted pendulum controlled by Bluetooth through a smartphone.

![3D-Calou.png](/img/3D-Calou.png)
It is a personal project entirely 3D print and powered by two RC Brushless BR2804-100T Gimbal Motor and a 2-axis Brushless Gimbal Controller BGC3.1 MOSFET card in a close loop with angle magnetic encoders. Those parts need some modification &/o adaptation to be assemble. The Controller with the IMU and Bluetooth module HC-05 are located into the head while the Body holds in the center a 500mA – 11.1V – 30C LiPo battery with a switch. The arms and legs of the robot serve as wire guide for motors and encoders.

The program was adapted from an application example developed by [Antun Skuric](https://askuric.github.io/), founder of the SimpleFOC project: Arduino library implementing a Field Oriented Control (FOC) algorithm for BLDC and Stepper motors: [Arduino-FOC-balancer](https://github.com/simplefoc/Arduino-FOC-balancer)

CALOU is the mascot of the French Robotic Association [Caliban](https://www.facebook.com/AssoCaliban)

It can be controlled through a smartphone by using a remote Bluetooth app and simple commands. 
I hope you will enjoy building this robot and have fun seeing it moving and stabilize and blinking its antenna.
